### Customer Segmentation Using RFM

## What is RFM(recency, frequency, monetary) Analysis?
RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to quantitatively rank and group customers based on the recency, frequency and monetary total of their recent transactions to identify the best customers and perform targeted marketing campaigns. The system assigns each customer numerical scores based on these factors to provide an objective analysis. RFM analysis is based on the marketing adage that "80% of your business comes from 20% of your customers."

RFM analysis scores customers on each of the three main factors. Generally, a score from 1 to 5 is given, with 5 being the highest. Various implementations of an RFM analysis system may use slightly different values or scaling, however.

## Problem Statement
An e-commerce company wants to segment its customers and determine marketing strategies according to these segments.
The company believes that marketing activities specific to customer segments that exhibit common behaviors will increase revenue.
